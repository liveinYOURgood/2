      <h1>Wonderful Times!</h1>

      <p>Many years ago I was lucky to meet this wonderful girl off A.O.L. (American Online) and we fast became great friends. I was in NJ and she was out of state. It was a long distance relationship that grew into mutual respectful times. I even got along very well with her mom then. We lost contact. What could have been? Today in 2025, and now almost 2026, I wonder how she's doing today? I am very curious to know, that's all. 🙏</p>

      <h1 class="TitleRed">Her name became Mia to me!</h1>


      <p>From one of many phone conversations, I thought her name was Mia as I kept calling her Mia then... so she kindly said, "Who is Mia? 😍 My name is Tiffany." It's a good thing she liked me. haha 😁 ...So my name became Ned (Don't call me Billy, call me Ned I replied...) from that point too to even the wonderful score here! </p>

      <h1 class="TitleRed">Tiffany loves <span class="greentea"> Green Tea!</span></h1>


      <p>Her mom Lisa would back up this claim as it being her number one goto drink! Even her horse and dog Boots and Bucket would agree too! Lisa and Paul were such great people!</p>

      <h1>A Message in a Bottle!</h1>

      <p>Did you ever meet someone that touched your life in a extremely positive way? That situation happened for me then and her name is/was Tiffany. After all these years, it would be awesome to know how's she's doing today? That's it, maybe someone will see this that knows her and will pass it along to Tiffany or to her family or friends. My name is Billy (below) and it's nice to meet you. My email link is in the footer below. Thank you and God Bless!</p>

      <h1>About me today!</h1>


      <p>I'm single, never married, no kids, I am in Northern New Jersey.  Just a plain old good guy that learned web design recently after a successful past graphic design career.  However, I am a long suffering Pittsburgh Steelers fan looking for a playoff win soon, haha 😁 Please pass along this website. Ned misses Mia!</p>
